        <h3 class="subHeading">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The MOT program at Connecticut State University serves the needs of professional technologists, engineers and managers in their progression into management-level positions. The program instructs and trains engineers and scientists, and motivated people from any discipline who have a need to make management decisions in a technology environment or will be involved in the management of such functions as technology research and development, product design, manufacturing, human and physical resources, product and system test, information and data analysis, and product and service support.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">The program is intended for technologists and those involved in technology-dependent enterprises who aspire to favorably position their companies in fast-paced markets, influence crucial decision-making in pursuing new technologies and improve the likelihood of corporate success. Graduates of the program are able to help their organizations embrace technology innovation in a timely fashion, focusing the energy of their companies on translating research and development efforts rapidly and effectively into manufacturing strategies and products that satisfy market needs.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This two-year graduate degree program is designed to enhance your technical experience with advanced management and leadership skills. The program addresses the needs of the technically trained employee who must use business principles across the entire gamut of engineering disciplines. The non-technically trained person will also benefit from this program as business management has become intertwined with technology. Learning the skills this program affords will help prepare you to manage the domestic and global resources and processes required in today's business environment.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">MSMOT graduates become effective leaders in small and large companies, providing creative guidance to the development and/or adoption and marketing of technology products and services. Specific program objectives include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="paragraph">To train the technically proficient by adding to their skills a deeper comprehension of business planning and economics, and an understanding of global markets, thereby empowering them to develop entrepreneurial skills. Technologists who are, or aspire to be employed as managers or supervisors and who currently engage in technology planning and development will be immersed in an educational program that integrates studies in technology management with modern management principles and practices.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">To enhance the skills of technologists in the design and manufacturing disciplines, in the management and effective use of information resources, and in the developing strategies that are crucial to effective leadership in technological entrepreneurship.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">To provide graduates in engineering, science and other disciplines with the opportunity to pursue a graduate program that expands their career paths and ultimately leads to leadership roles in technology-dependent businesses.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">To provide technology-dependent business and industry enterprises in Connecticut with people skilled in the management of technology and capable of enhancing the strength and competitiveness of those businesses. The outcome will serve to enrich the entrepreneurial climate in the state.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">To learn the skills relevant to today's competitive global environment where technology is increasingly a core competency of all organizations.</li>
        </ul>
