        <h3 class="subHeading">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The ME program is designed as a course of study to provide graduate engineers with a deeper and broader understanding of the methods and skills in the area of mechanical engineering.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">The program outcomes are achieved through knowledge and skills that students gain by virtue of expert curriculum design, instruction in an effective learning environment, and opportunities for inquiry and professional development.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">Students will take courses in the following broad domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="paragraph">Thermal Systems: This domain includes instruction in renewable energy, energy conversion, computational fluid dynamics, turbomachinery, gas dynamics, heat and mass transfer.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Mechanical Systems: This domain includes courses in applications of theory of elasticity, advanced kinematics, advanced dynamics, composite materials and fracture mechanics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">Students will be able to identify, formulate, and solve advanced mechanical engineering problems. They will also be able to use the techniques, skills, and modern analytical and software tools necessary for the mechanical engineering practice. Sequences of electives, as well as a master's Project/Thesis, will assist in achieving the program's learning goals.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Program Overview</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="paragraph">The aim of the MSME program is to achieve the following basic objectives:</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Students will be educated in methods of advanced engineering analysis, including the mathematical and computational skills required for advanced problem solving. They will be trained to develop the skills and the ability to formulate solutions to problems, to think independently and creatively, to synthesize and integrate information/data, and to work and communicate effectively.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Students will avail themselves of a breadth of knowledge that fosters an awareness of and skills for interdisciplinary approaches to engineering problems.</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Undergraduate students in mechanical, aerospace, civil, chemical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering have the opportunity to pursue, upon completion of their undergraduate studies, a graduate program that would allow them broader career paths and leadership roles in the mechanical engineering area. Students outside the above engineering fields will be assigned to take specific bridge courses in their area of specialization interest to meet the course prerequisite.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Students</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Mechanical engineering is a highly diverse discipline that ranges from the aesthetic aspects of design to highly technical research and development. The student population for the MSME program has several origins. Typical examples are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="paragraph">Engineers and scientists who, responding to the specific needs of their industry across the spectrum of special domains listed above, need to acquire skills so that they may effectively guide the development of technologies which will enhance product quality and business opportunities</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Engineers and scientists who wish to fulfill their need for personal and professional growth in the mechanical engineering domain</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Engineers who aspire to academic careers and those who wish to eventually continue their studies toward a Ph.D. degree</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Engineers aspiring to a career change</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Current undergraduate engineering students and alumni who desire an opportunity to continue their studies for an advanced engineering degree at Fairfield University</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subHeading">The ME Curriculum</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The ME program offers two options for graduation: (a) a thesis option which requires 33 credits, including the two-term thesis, and (b) the non-thesis option which requires 36 credit hours.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Required Courses</h3>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subHeading">In both options, the program entails five required courses as follows:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">ME 400 Feedback and Control Systems</p>
        <p class="paragraph">ME 451 Energy Conversion</p>
        <p class="paragraph">ME 425 Engineering Applications of Numerical Methods</p>
        <p class="paragraph">ME 470 Applications of Finite Element Analysis</p>
        <p class="paragraph">SW 407 Introduction to Programming</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Thesis Option</h3>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subHeading">Students may choose the thesis option provided they select an academic advisor and secure the approval of the program director.</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">In the event that a student in the thesis track wishes to switch to the non-thesis option, credits that might have been earned in the pursuit of a thesis will not count toward fulfilling the graduation requirement.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Core Concentration Courses</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Students select seven elective courses from the list below. The objective of the core concentration elective courses is to provide students with areas of in-depth study, which are at the core of their major interests and career objectives. The core concentration elective courses are as follows:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>1. Thermal Systems:</strong> This domain considers the broad areas of energy and turbomachinery, fluid dynamics and heat transfer.
